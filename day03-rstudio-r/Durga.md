**Sketch on my understanding of other methods vs Git**

- Initially when there is no enough exposure to every area of the Git , it is challenging to anyone and I was in the same spot. The dependency with other repositories and maintaing large files on the Git would be challenging unlike other file sharing methods.
- The positives about Git I could able to figure out are : The track of all the updates from the main branch, who ever does commits can be tracked and being able to see the updates and changes if made in the code, trying to edit and update multiple times.
