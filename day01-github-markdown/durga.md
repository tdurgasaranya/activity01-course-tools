# Week 1 in a nutshell

- Trying to understand and learn git was a challenging experience. I chose the above meme because the character represents me trying to learn everything at once.

- With the learning experience from Git I would like to share the learning notes through markdown files and share the personal repo link to peers to read my content, with the process of learning git file_information experience I would get my hands on git now.

- I personally liked Tanya Shapiro portfolio because of the way of her skills presentation and clearly expressing what her skillset is and what would clients require. It is a right amount of information sharing.
